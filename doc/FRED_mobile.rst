This document describes how to access and run the FRED mobile app on
your smart phone or tablet.  The FRED mobile app lets you request FRED
simulations and view results on your mobile device.

#. Aim your device's browser at the FRED web site
   ``http://fred.publichealth.pitt.edu``.  You will redirected to the
   mobile site. You can click on the **Full Site** button to access the
   full web site from a mobile device.

#. Now click on the **Get Started** button to request a FRED simulation
   for a specific location and epidemic scenario.

#. Choose a state from the pull-down menu.

#. Choose a city within the selected state.

#. Select epidemic severity:

   * A value of "High" corresponds to a basic reproductive rate R0 of about 2.2

   * A value of "Medium" corresponds to a basic reproductive rate R0 of about 1.7

   * A value of "Low" corresponds to a basic reproductive rate R0 of about 1.2

   The actual R0 value for a given epidemic depend on the population
   density and age structure of the selected city.

#. The display will change to the Results page for the requested
   simulation showing two movies:

   * A movie of the epidemic spread with no prior population immunization.

   * A movie of the epidemic spread with 50% of the population immunized.
