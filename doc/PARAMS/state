PARAM NAME: state
DEFAULT VALUE: none
TYPE: string

DEFINITION: The state format can be the state name or abbreviation, such
as: state = New York or state = NY.  The synthetic_population_id
parameter is the default determinant of the population files used in
FRED.  The parameters "fips", "city", "county", and "state", if set,
will override the default, in that order of precedence.  That is, a FIPS
code overrides a city name, which overrides county and so on.  In all
cases, the name is ultimately transformed into a FIPS code.

Example:

state = PA
