PARAM NAME: reseed_day
DEFAULT VALUE: -1
TYPE: int

DEFINITION: If reseed_day > -1, start each run with the same random seed
and then reset the seed at day reseed_day. The effect is that the
initial days will follow the same trajectory, but the simulations will
follow independent trajectories starting on reseed_day. This permits
estimation of conditional variance.
