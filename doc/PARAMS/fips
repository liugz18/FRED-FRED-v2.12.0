PARAM NAME: fips
DEFAULT VALUE: none
TYPE: string
DEFINITION: string If set, has highest precedence and overrides city,
state and county. See explanation below.  The synthetic_population_id
parameter is the default determinant of the population files used in
FRED.  The parameters "fips", "city", "county", and "state", if set,
will override the default, in that order of precedence.  That is, a FIPS
code overrides a city name, which overrides county and so on.  In all
cases, the name is ultimately transformed into a FIPS code.
