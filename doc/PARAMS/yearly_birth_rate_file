PARAM NAME: yearly_birth_rate_file
DEFAULT VALUE: none
TYPE: string

DEFINITION: File of age-specific rate at which female agents give birth.
If population-dynamics is enabled, then each female of child-bearing age
may become pregnant on any simulation day using age-specific maternity
rates provided in the yearly_maternity_rate_file.  Upon becoming
pregnant, the agent is assigned a due-date based on a Gaussian
distribution with a mean of 280 days and a standard deviation of 7
days. When the due-date arrives, the mother gives birth to a new agent
who is assigned a random sex and is assigned to the same household as
the mother.
