PARAM NAME: synthetic_population_id
DEFAULT VALUE: 2005_2009_ver2_42003
TYPE:  string

DEFINITION: Defaults to Allegheny County Population (RTI Ver 2).  The
synthetic_population_id parameter is the default determinant of the
population files used in FRED.  The parameters "fips", "city", "county",
and "state", if set, will override the default, in that order of
precedence.  That is, a FIPS code overrides a city name, which overrides
county and so on.  In all cases, the name is ultimately transformed into
a FIPS code.
