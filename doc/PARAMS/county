PARAM NAME: county
DEFAULT VALUE: none
TYPE: string
DEFINITION: If set, overrides state.  Format is "name
state_abbreviation".  The synthetic_population_id parameter is the
default determinant of the population files used in FRED.  The
parameters "fips", "city", "county", and "state", if set, will override
the default, in that order of precedence.  That is, a FIPS code
overrides a city name, which overrides county and so on.  In all cases,
the name is ultimately transformed into a FIPS code.
