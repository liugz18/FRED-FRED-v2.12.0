PARAM NAME: num_demes
DEFAULT VALUE: 1
TYPE: int

DEFINITION: A deme is a local population of people whose households are
contained in the same bounded geographic region.  The
synthetic_population_id is used to define demes. No Synthetic Population
ID may have more than one Deme ID, but a Deme ID may contain many
Synthetic Population IDs. One deme is defined by default. To create a
deme with more than one contiguous county, set the
synthetic_population_id to a space delimited list of population ids. For
example:

    synthetic_population_id = 2005_2009_ver2_42003 2005_2009_ver2_42007

To use more than one deme, set the number of demes and set additional
synthetic population ids using array notation.

    num_demes = 2
      
    synthetic_population_id = 2005_2009_ver2_42003 
      
    synthetic_population_id[1] = 2005_2009_ver2_42007
     
Only the Allegheny County population files are included in the FRED
download. Additional population files can be downloaded from

populations directory.
