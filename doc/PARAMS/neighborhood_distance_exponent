PARAM NAME: neighborhood_distance_exponent
DEFAULT VALUE: 3.0
TYPE: int

DEFINITION: Used by the neighborhood gravity model (on by default).
This feature uses a gravity model for Neighborhood transmission.  The
probability of visiting a neighborhood patch is defined using formula
similar to Ferguson (2005):

f(d) ~ pop(d)^c / [1 + (d/a)^b ]

where

d = distance between a person's home neighborhood and the destination

pop(d) = population in the destination neighborhood

a = distance at which f(d) is 1/2 the value of the home neighborhood if
    populations are equal.

b = an exponent that weights the importance of distance

c = an exponent that weights the importance of the destination
population

Ferguson suggests values of a = 4km and b = 3 from UK commuting patterns
data.
