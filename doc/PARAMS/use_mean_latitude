PARAM NAME: use_mean_latitude
DEFAULT VALUE: 0
TYPE: int

DEFINITION: If use_mean_latitude = 1, then the mean latitude in the
households file is used for the planar projection from
(longitude,latitude) to (x,y) coordinates.  This is recommended for
regions substantially North or South from the US mean latitude.  If set
to 0 (the default), then the mean US latitude is used.
