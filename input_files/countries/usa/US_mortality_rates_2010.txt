Caveats:
"1. Population and rates are labeled 'Not Applicable' when they include a subset of ages 85-100+ because populations are not"
"available for those ages. More information: http://wonder.cdc.gov/wonder/help/ucd.html#Ages 85-100."
"2. Deaths of persons with Age ""Not Stated"" are included in ""All"" counts and rates, but are not distributed among age groups,"
"so are not included in age-specific counts, age-specific rates or in any age-adjusted rates. More information:"
"http://wonder.cdc.gov/wonder/help/ucd.html#Not Stated."
"3. The population figures for year 2012 are bridged-race estimates of the July 1 resident population, from the Vintage 2012"
"postcensal series released by NCHS on June 13, 2013. The population figures for year 2011 are bridged-race estimates of the July"
"1 resident population, from the Vintage 2011 postcensal series released by NCHS on July 18, 2012. Population figures for 2010"
"are April 1 Census counts. The population figures for years 2001 - 2009 are bridged-race estimates of the July 1 resident"
"population, from the revised intercensal county-level 2000 - 2009 series released by NCHS on October 26, 2012. Population"
"figures for 2000 are April 1 Census counts. Population figures for 1999 are from the 1990-1999 intercensal series of July 1"
"estimates. Population figures for the infant age groups are the number of live births. <br/><b>Note:</b> Rates and population"
"figures for years 2001 - 2009 differ slightly from previously published reports, due to use of the population estimates which"
"were available at the time of release."
"4. The population figures used in the calculation of death rates for the age group 'under 1 year' are the estimates of the"
"resident population that is under one year of age. More information: http://wonder.cdc.gov/wonder/help/ucd.html#Age Group."
