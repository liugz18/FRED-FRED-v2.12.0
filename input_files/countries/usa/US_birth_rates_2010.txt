Caveats:
"1. Each birth record represents one living baby."
"2. Data are Suppressed when the data meet the criteria for confidentiality constraints. More information:"
"http://wonder.cdc.gov/wonder/help/Natality.html#Assurance of Confidentiality."
"3. Fertility rates are calculated as the number of births divided by the number of females age 15 - 44 years old in the given"
"year(s). When the numerator is sub-set by mother's age, mother's race, location, or year of birth, then the same sub-set for"
"age, race, location and year applies to the denominator population."
"4. The populations displayed and used as the denominator for rates are bridged-race July 1st estimates of the resident"
"population. More information: http://wonder.cdc.gov/wonder/help/Natality.html#Denominator-Population-Sources."
"5. Birth rates and fertility rates are calculated using the following populations. The populations for year 2011 are from the"
"postcensal bridged-race series of July 1st estimates of the resident population, released by NCHS on July 18, 2012. The"
"populations for year 2010 are the bridged-race April 1, 2010 Census counts. The populations for years 2007-2009 are from the"
"revised intercensal bridged-race series of July 1st estimates of the resident population, released by NCHS on October 26, 2012."
