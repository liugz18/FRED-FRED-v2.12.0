FRED Exercises

6. PLOTTING RESULTS: THE fred_plot COMMAND

NOTE: The fred_plot command requires that you have gnuplot installed on
your computer.

The fred_plot create plots of one or more FRED output variables, from
one or more fred_jobs.  For example, the following command will produce
a plot of the attack rate AR for job ex4:

fred_plot -k ex4 -v AR

You can plot several variable at once:

fred_plot -k ex4 -v S -v E -v I -v R

You can alter the title:

fred_plot -k ex4 -v S -v E -v I -v R -T "Influenza in Punxsutawney"

You can include errorbars:

fred_plot -k ex4 -v S -v E -v I -v R -T "Influenza in Punxsutawney" -e

You can normalize to the population size, use plot using weekly bar charts:

fred_plot -k ex4 -v C -T "Influenza in Punxsutawney" --norm --hist --week

The fred_plot command include several other options:

fred_plot -k key -v var [ options ], where options include:
       -h: print this help message.
       -e: include errorbars on plot.
       -f fontsize: specify "small", "medium", "large" or "giant" font.
       -k key [ -k key ... ]: keys of jobs to plot
       -s: save the gnuplot command file and the PNG file
       -T title: Title to appear on plot.
       -v var [ -v var ... ]: variable to be plotted.
       -x xmin: min value for x-axis.
       -X xmax: max value for x-axis.
       -y ymin: min value for y-axis.
       -Y ymax: max value for y-axis.
       -o outfile: send output image to indicated file.
       --pdf: make pdf file if set (default)
       --data: print x,y values to standard output.
       --epi: label weeks by epi week numbers instead of simulation weeks.
       --histogram: plot histograms instead of curves.
       --name: return the name of the plot file only.
       --normalize: scale y-axis to show counts per 100,000 people.
       --weekly: plot variables averaged over epi weeks, with a smooth spline curve.
