5. GETTING INFORMATION FROM A FRED JOB

FRED provide several command for retrieving information from a FRED job:

fred_status -k key    print the status of job
fred_AR -k key        print the final attack rate
fred_R0 -k key        print the basic reproductive rate
fred_find -k key      print the location of the job  files
fred_log -k key       print the last few lines of the log file
fred_csv -k key       print a csv file with the FRED output variables

Try these commands out on your job "ex4".


THE fred_csv COMMAND

You can use the fred_csv command to obtain a report giving the values of
FRED output variables for each day of the simulation.  If the job
included multiple runs, you will get the mean and standard deviation for
each variable, for each day.  You can save this report to a file that
can be opened using a spreadsheet program, e.g. Excel.  The following
creates a spreadsheet file of the daily values of all FRED output
variables, averaged over all runs.

fred_csv -k ex4 > ex4.csv

If you want the data for a single run, e.g., run 2, use:

fred_csv -k ex4 -r 2 > ex4_run2.csv

If you only want the time series for a single output variable, say
attack rate AR, you could use the command:

fred_csv -k ex4 -v AR > ex4_AR.csv
