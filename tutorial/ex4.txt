FRED Exercises

4. FRED JOB CONTROL COMMANDS

The fred_job command is used to create a FRED job, consisting of one or
more FRED simulations that use the same parameters.  FRED jobs are
identified by a key that the use selects to help documents the job.  The
following command will create a FRED job that includes 5 runs of FRED
with the given parameters:

% fred_job -k ex4 -p params -n 5 > ex4.out &

The "&" symbol runs the job in the background, so you can continue
working in the terminal.

All the data associated with a job is stored in the FRED/RESULTS
database. You can manage the database using these commands:

fred_status -k key	 shows the current status of the specified job
fred_jobs      		 lists all jobs in RESULTS database
fred_clear_all_results	 delete all job in RESULTS database
fred_delete -k key	 delete the job with given key
